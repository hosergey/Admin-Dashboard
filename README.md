## Description:
This project is a personal endeavor to create a React Admin Dashboard from scratch. Leveraging React, Material UI, Nivo Charts, Formik, Yup, FullCalendar, and Data Grid, the application boasts both Light and Dark Mode themes. It encompasses 4 distinct types of charts, 3 varied data table pages, an FAQ page, a form page, and seamless calendar integration. Key resources utilized include create-react-app for React project setup, Material UI for UI components, Nivo Charts for data visualization, FullCalendar for calendar functionality, and Formik/Yup for form management and validation. Additional enhancements are achieved through resources like Google Fonts and react pro sidebar.
